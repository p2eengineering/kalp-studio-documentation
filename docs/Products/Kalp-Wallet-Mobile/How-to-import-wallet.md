Managing your digital assets securely requires a robust and trustworthy wallet. The Kalp Wallet app offers a convenient way to access your existing crypto holdings. This guide will walk you through the process of importing your wallet using your seed phrases.

### **Step 1: Accessing the Import Wallet Option**

Launch the Kalp Wallet app. On the main screen, you'll be presented with two options: "Create A New Wallet" and "Import Wallet." Since you're importing an existing wallet, select the "Import Wallet" button.

### **Step 2: Entering Your Seed Phrases**

The next screen will prompt you to "Enter Seed Phrases." This is a crucial step, and **extreme caution is advised.** Your seed phrases are the key to your cryptocurrency. **Never share these phrases with anyone and store them securely offline.**

The camera function Kalp Wallet is typically designed for **seed phrase import via image scanning**. Instead of manually typing in your 12-24 word seed phrase, you'd use your phone's camera to take a picture of a written or printed copy of your seed phrase.

### **Step 3: Setting a New Password and Biometric Security (Optional)**

After entering your seed phrases, you'll be asked to create a new password for your Kalp Wallet. The password must meet specific criteria, which are displayed on the screen. This password, combined with your seed phrases, is what you'll use to access your wallet on this particular device. The password security guidelines ensure your funds are protected.

The app also gives you the option to unlock your wallet using your device's biometric security (fingerprint or face ID). This is an additional layer of protection, but remember that your seed phrases remain the ultimate key.

### **Step 4: Importing Your Wallet**

Once you've entered your seed phrases, created your password, and made your biometric security choice (optional), click the "Import" button. The app will verify your seed phrases.

### **Step 5: Successful Import and Verification**

If the import is successful, the app will display a confirmation message, "Wallet Imported Successfully." You'll then be able to view your wallet balance and transaction history. The app will display your wallet address, which you can use to receive crypto.

Importing your wallet into the Kalp Wallet app is a straightforward process, provided you follow these steps carefully. The security of your crypto assets depends entirely on the secure storage and handling of your seed phrases. Always prioritize security and double-check all steps to prevent the risk of losing your funds.
