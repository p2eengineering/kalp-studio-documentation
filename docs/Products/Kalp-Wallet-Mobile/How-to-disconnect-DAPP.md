# How to Disconnect Dapp?

Decentralized applications (DApps) often require connection to your cryptocurrency wallet to function. While this connection enables seamless interactions, it's crucial to manage these connections for security. This article guides you through disconnecting a DApp from your Kalp Wallet.

**Step 1: Access Wallet Settings**

Open your Kalp Wallet application. Navigate to the main menu. Select "Settings" from the list of options. The location of the settings menu may vary slightly depending on the version of your app.
