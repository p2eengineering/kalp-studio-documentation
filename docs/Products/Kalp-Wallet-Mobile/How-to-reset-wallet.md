Losing access to your digital wallet can be a frustrating experience. The Kalp Wallet app provides a straightforward process for removing and resetting your wallet, ensuring you regain control and protect your assets.

It's crucial to understand that "resetting" your Kalp Wallet doesn't simply mean changing your password. Instead, removing your wallet from your device permanently deletes all associated data from that particular device. This includes your balance and transaction history. Therefore, **before proceeding, you must ensure you have your seed phrase safely stored in a secure location that only you can access**. The seed phrase is your recovery key without it, you will lose all access to your funds.

### **Step 1: Access the Settings Menu**

Open your Kalp Wallet app. Navigate to the settings menu.

**Step 2: Locate the "Remove Wallet" Option**

Within the settings, scroll down to find the "Security & Privacy" section. You'll find an option labelled "Remove Wallet," often accompanied by a trash can icon. Tap this option.

### **Step 3: Confirmation and Seed Phrase Reminder**

The app will present a warning screen explicitly stating that this action will permanently delete your wallet data from the device. A prominent reminder will emphasize the importance of having your seed phrase securely stored. Review this warning carefully.

### **Step 4: Authentication**

Before proceeding, the app requires an additional layer of security. This might involve biometric authentication (fingerprint or face ID) if enabled or, failing that, will prompt you to enter your wallet password. Input the correct credentials to proceed.

### **Step 6: Wallet Removal Complete**

After confirmation, your wallet will be successfully removed from your device. You will be returned to the Kalp Wallet's main screen where you can choose to "Import Wallet" using your seed phrase or "Create A New Wallet".

Removing and resetting your Kalp Wallet is a significant action. Following the above steps carefully ensures a smooth and secure process.
