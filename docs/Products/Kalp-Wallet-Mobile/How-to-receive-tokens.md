### Step 3: QR Code Displayed

This action will immediately display a QR code representing your wallet's unique receive address. The actual address will also be shown below the QR code for manual copying or sharing. This QR code can be scanned using another device to expedite the transfer process.

### **Step 4: Copying Your Receive Address**

You can copy your receive address manually by selecting the text field containing your unique address and then selecting the copy option (the clipboard icon beside it). A confirmation message, "Copied!", will appear briefly at the top of your screen indicating that your address has been copied.

### **Step 5: Sharing Your Receive Address (Optional)**

If you need to share your receive address, simply tap the share icon (the square with an arrow pointing upwards) next to the address. You can choose your preferred sharing method, such as Quick Share, uploading to Photos, Google Drive, printing it, or sharing the address through a mapping application. This method offers flexibility in sharing your receive address.

### **Step 6: Receiving Tokens**

Share the QR code or copied address with the sender. They can then scan the QR code or paste the address into their sending application to initiate the transfer of tokens to your Kalp Wallet. Once the sender completes the transaction, the received tokens will appear in your Kalp Wallet balance, allowing you to review your transactions.

Receiving tokens on the Kalp Wallet mobile application is a straightforward and secure process. By following the steps outlined above, you can confidently receive digital assets into your wallet.
