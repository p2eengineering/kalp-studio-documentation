### **Step 6: Scan the QR Code**

You'll then see a QR code displayed on the screen. Open the KALP Studio Wallet appâ€™s QR code scanner (usually found through a "Scan" icon within the app menu) and point your device's camera at the QR code displayed on your screen. Alternatively, if the DApp offers a non-QR connection method (such as through a direct URL connection in the DApp's settings), follow those instructions.

### **Step 7: Approve the Request**

Once the QR code is scanned, the KALP Studio Wallet app will display an "Approve Request" screen. This screen will show the DApp's name, its URL, and the permissions it's requesting. **Carefully review these permissions.** If you are comfortable with the permissions, tap "Connect". If not, tap "Reject".
