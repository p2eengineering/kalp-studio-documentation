### **Step 6: Finalize Settings**

Once the domain is added, you can navigate back to other sections or return to the dashboard. Your app is now configured with the specified domain, allowing it to connect to KS Pay services under this domain.

Following the above steps, you cam seamlessly add domain name for the further payment processes. The domain name ensures that the payment is directed for the correct application. As the domain name is unique for each application, the chances of any error minimizes.
