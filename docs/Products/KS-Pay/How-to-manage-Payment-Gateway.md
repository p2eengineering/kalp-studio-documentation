#### Step 2: Add Payment Gateways

1.  In the Payment Gateway Settings page, youâ€™ll see a list of existing payment gateways associated with the currency.
    
2.  To add a new gateway, click on **+ Add Gateway**.
    
3.  Choose the gateway you wish to add and select the currency it supports (e.g., USD or Rupees).
    
4.  Once added, the gateway will appear under the relevant currency with options to verify or disable it.
    

#### Step 3: Verify Payment Gateways

1.  Verified gateways are marked with a green checkmark. To verify a gateway, select the **Edit** (pencil) icon next to the gateway name.
    
2.  Complete any required verification steps provided by the gateway provider.
    
3.  Once verified, the status should update automatically.

1.  Use the toggle switch next to each gateway to **enable** or **disable** it. Enabled gateways will be active for transactions.
    
2.  For a gateway to be fully operational, it needs to be both enabled and verified.
    

#### Step 5: Set Payment Gateway Priority

1.  Click on **Set Priority** at the bottom of the Payment Gateway section.
    
2.  A panel will appear where you can drag and drop gateways based on your desired priority.
    
3.  Place the most preferred gateway at the top of the list, and arrange others below as fallback options.
    
4.  Save your priority settings once satisfied.
    

#### Step 6: Manage Currency and Payment Modes

1.  Under the **Set Priority** section, you can select specific **Currencies** (e.g., USD or Rupees).
    
2.  For each currency, specify the **Payment Modes** such as PayPal or Net Banking.
    
3.  Drag to rearrange payment modes if you need to prioritize certain options over others.
    

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your payment gateway options in KS Pay, ensuring a seamless experience for users making transactions in multiple currencies.
