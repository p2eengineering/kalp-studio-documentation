# **How to add credits for SMS Service?**

Kalp Studio provides robust tools for developers and businesses to build, manage, and scale their applications, including essential communication services like SMS and Email. To ensure your SMS services run uninterrupted, maintaining an adequate credit balance is crucial. This guide will walk you through the simple process of adding SMS credits to your Kalp Studio account.

Running out of credits means your application will no longer be able to send SMS messages, potentially disrupting user verifications, notifications, or marketing campaigns. Regularly topping up your SMS credits ensures continuous service and smooth operation.
