# How to view all your NFTs?

Kalp Studio offers a streamlined interface for viewing and managing your NFT portfolio. This guide will walk you through accessing and viewing your NFTs in both grid and list formats.

Make sure to connect your wallet first to see all NFTs created on that network.

### **Step 1: Access the NFT Portfolio**

1.  Open ‘NFT Creator’ by logging into KALP Studio console.
    
2.  In ‘NFT Creator’, navigate to the **NFT Portfolio** section located at the left sidebar menu.
    
3.  Select ‘All NFTs’ under the NFT Portfolio to view all your created NFTs.
    

### **Step 2: Viewing NFTs in Grid Layout**

The grid layout is the default view for NFTs in Kalp Studio’s NFT Creator, presenting assets visually with easy-to-read thumbnails.

1.  Upon entering the **All NFTs** section, you will see your assets displayed as tiles.
    
2.  Each tile provides the following details:
    

-   **Asset Thumbnail**: A preview image of the NFT.
    
-   **Asset Name**: The title or name of the NFT.
    
-   **Catalog Name**: The Collection name under which the NFT was created.
    
-   **Catalog ID**: A unique identifier for the catalog, useful for tracking and referencing.
    
-   **Network logo**: A logo of the chain on which the NFT was created is also presented on NFT cards.
    

### **Step 3: Switching to List Layout**

If you prefer a detailed, table-based view, switch to the list layout by following these steps:

1.  Click on the **List Icon** (highlighted in red in the screenshot) located at the top right of the grid view.
    
2.  This will switch your NFTs to a list format with detailed rows for each NFT.
    

In the list view, you’ll find:

-   **Asset Name**: The name of each NFT.
    
-   **Asset ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each NFT, essential for inventory management.
    
-   **Catalog ID**: This is the catalog's blockchain address, making it easy to track on-chain data.
    
-   **Catalog Name**: The category to which each NFT belongs.
    
-   **View on Blockchain**: A clickable link to view the NFT transaction details on the blockchain.
    

### **Step 4: Viewing NFTs on the Blockchain**

For each NFT, the platform provides a direct link to view its blockchain record.

1.  In the list view, locate the **View on Blockchain** column.
    
2.  Click the link next to an NFT to view it on the Blockchain explorer in a new tab.
    
3.  This provides complete insights of your NFT transaction on that Blockchain.
    

NFT Creator’s dual viewing modes - **grid and list** offer flexibility for users to explore their NFTs conveniently. Whether you need a quick visual overview or detailed metadata, these options make it easy to manage your NFT portfolio effectively.
