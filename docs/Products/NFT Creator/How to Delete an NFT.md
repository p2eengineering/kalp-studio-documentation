# How to Delete NFT?

Managing your digital assets is an essential part of maintaining a streamlined and organized NFT portfolio. As your collection grows, you may occasionally need to remove certain NFTs, whether to declutter, replace outdated assets, or make room for new additions.

KALP Studio's NFT Creator makes it easy to delete NFTs directly from your portfolio.

### **Step 1: Access the NFT Portfolio**

1.  For added security, an **OTP (One-Time Password)** will be sent to your registered email ID.
    
2.  Enter the 6-digit OTP in the provided fields.
    
3.  Click on **Confirm.**
    

No transaction charges will be levied if minted on KALP DLT.

This process ensures that your NFT is deleted both from your Kalp Studio portfolio and the blockchain, with secure verification steps in place.

Always ensure that you genuinely want to delete the NFT, as this action cannot be undone.
