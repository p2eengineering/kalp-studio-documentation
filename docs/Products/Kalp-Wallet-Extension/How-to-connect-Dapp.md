### **Step 3: Initiate the Connection**

1.  Look for a **"Connect Wallet"** button on the DApp's interface, usually located in the top-right corner.
    
2.  Click on the button, and a list of wallet options will appear.
    

### **Step 4: Select Kalp Wallet**

1.  Choose **"Kalp Wallet"** from the list of wallets.
    
    -   If "Kalp Wallet" is not listed explicitly, select an option like **"MetaMask"** or **"WalletConnect"** if the wallet supports similar protocols.
        
2.  The Kalp Wallet extension will automatically open or prompt for connection approval.
    

### **Step 5: Approve the Connection**

1.  A pop-up in the Kalp Wallet extension will ask for your permission to connect to the DApp.
    
2.  Review the details, including:
    

-   The DApp's URL.
    
-   The requested permissions.
    

3.  Click **"Approve"** or **"Connect"** to allow access.
    

### **Step 6: Verify the Connection**

1.  Once connected, the DApp will display your wallet address in its interface, indicating a successful connection.
    
2.  Check your Kalp Wallet extension to ensure the DApp is listed under the connected sites.

### **Step 7: Interact with the DApp**

1.  You can now use the features of the DApp, such as:
    

-   Viewing balances.
    
-   Signing transactions.
    
-   Interacting with smart contracts.
    

2.  Each transaction or action will prompt a confirmation in the Kalp Wallet extension. Review and approve transactions carefully.
    

### **Tips:**

-   **Switch Network**: Ensure the wallet is on the correct blockchain network (e.g., Kalp Chain) if the DApp requires it. The DApp may prompt a network switch if needed.
    
-   **Security**: Only connect to trusted DApps to protect your wallet and funds.
    
-   **Gas Fees**: Keep sufficient GINI tokens for transaction fees when using the DApp.
    

By following these steps, you can seamlessly connect a DApp to the Kalp Wallet extension and utilize its features securely.
