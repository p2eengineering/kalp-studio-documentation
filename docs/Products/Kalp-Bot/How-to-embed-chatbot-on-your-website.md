This guide will walk you through the simple process of embedding your Kalp Bot onto your website, making it accessible to your visitors.

### Prerequisites:

-   A Kalp Studio account.
    
-   At least one chatbot created and configured within Kalp Studio.
    
-   Access to your website's HTML code.
    

### **Step 1: Log in and Navigate to Chatbots**

-   Log into your **Kalp Studio** account.

### **Step 2: Select Your Chatbot**

-   You will be directed to the "Chatbots" page, where a list or grid of your created chatbots will be displayed.
    
-   Identify the chatbot you wish to embed.
    
-   Click on the card or entry for that specific chatbot to open its configuration settings.

### **Step 3: Access the Embedding Options**

-   Once you're on the chatbot's configuration page, you'll find various customization options for its interface and sources.
    
-   Look for the **"Embed on Website"** button. This is located in the top-right corner of the chatbot settings interface, often near the chatbot ID.

### **Step 4: Copy the Embed Script**

-   Clicking the "Embed on Website" button will trigger a pop-up modal.
    
-   This modal will display a snippet of HTML code. This code is a `<script>` tag specifically generated for your chatbot.
    
-   The modal will have a button, usually labeled **"Copy Script"** with a copy icon. Click this button to copy the entire script to your clipboard.

### **Step 5: Paste the Script into Your Website's HTML**

-   Now, you need to add this copied script to your website's HTML code.
    
-   The most common and recommended practice is to paste this script **just before the closing** `</body>` **tag** in your website's HTML file(s). Placing it here ensures that your main page content loads first, potentially improving perceived page load speed.
    

### **Step 6: Test Your Embedded Chatbot**

-   Once the script is added and your website changes are live, open your website in a browser.
    
-   The Kalp Bot chat widget should appear, usually in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
    
-   Interact with the chatbot to ensure it is functioning correctly, responding as configured, and displaying as expected.
