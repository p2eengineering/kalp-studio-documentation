# How to generate API Key on Kalp Bot?

Kalp Studio offers a suite of tools for managing knowledge bases, chatbots, and more. To extend its functionality and integrate it with other applications or services, API (Application Programming Interface) keys are essential. API keys act as unique identifiers and secret tokens for authentication, allowing your external applications to securely communicate with Kalp Studio's services.

This guide will walk you through the simple process of generating a new API key within your Kalp Studio dashboard.

### Prerequisites:

-   An active Kalp Studio account.
    
-   Access to your Kalp Studio dashboard.

2.  On the main dashboard, locate the left-hand navigation menu.
    
3.  Click on the **"API Keys"** option, typically indicated by a key icon.
    

**Step 2: Initiate API Key Creation**

**Step 3: Provide API Key Details**

1.  You will be redirected to the "Create API Key" page.
    
2.  You'll need to fill in the following details:
    
    -   **Enter Key Name:** Provide a descriptive name for your API key. This helps you identify its purpose later (e.g., "My Web App Integration," "Data Sync Script").
        
    -   **Description:** Add an optional, more detailed description for the key's use case.

2.  A modal window will pop up with the message: **"API Key has been successfully generated."**
    
3.  Your newly generated API key will be displayed in this modal. **This is the only time the full API key will be visible.**
    
4.  Click the **copy icon** next to the API key to copy it to your clipboard.

**Important:** Immediately paste this key into a secure location (like a password manager or a secure note). Once you close this modal, you will not be able to retrieve the full key again for security reasons.

**Step 5: View and Manage Your API Keys**

1.  After copying the key, you can click the **"View Details"** button in the modal, or simply close the modal.
    
2.  You will be taken to the "Keys' Details" page, which lists all your API keys.
    
3.  Here, you'll see your newly created key listed with its:
    
    -   **Name**
        
    -   A partial view of the **API Key** (for identification)
        
    -   **Date Created**
        
    -   **Status** (which can often be toggled to activate or deactivate the key)
