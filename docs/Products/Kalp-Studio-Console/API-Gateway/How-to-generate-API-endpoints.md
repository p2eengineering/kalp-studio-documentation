If you haven't subscribed to any API Gateway, you'll see a message prompting you to subscribe.

!!! Note 
    To create and manage API endpoints, you need to subscribe to one of the plans  
    offered by Kalp Studio. Ensure you upgrade your plan if you're currently on the free  
    tier to access more features and higher limits.

### **Create or Select a Smart Contract**
