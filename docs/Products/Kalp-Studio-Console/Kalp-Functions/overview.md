KALP Web3 Functions transform smart contracts from passive logic into **active, autonomous services**.  
They allow developers to automate execution, schedule transactions, or connect on-chain events with off-chain systems without needing to manage backend infrastructure.

### Understanding Your Needs

**On-Chain Only Automation?**  
If your automation logic can be verified entirely on-chain (like executing DAO proposals, claiming rewards, or running scheduled payments), you can use:

- Solidity Functions  
- Automated Transactions  

**Off-Chain Notifications or Integrations?**  
If you need to integrate external services (e.g., Slack alerts, email notifications, or bridging blockchain events to Web2 APIs), you can use **Webhooks**.  
This makes KALP Web3 Functions suitable for hybrid dApps that combine blockchain execution with real-world integrations.

## Implementation Flow

| Step | Action                          | Description                                                                 |
|------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose Your Trigger             | Decide how automation should start: time-based intervals, on-chain events, or per-block execution. |
| 2    | Decide What to Run              | Select the execution type: Solidity Function, Automated Transaction, or Webhook. |
| 3    | Task Creation                   | Create and configure a Web3 Function task through the KALP Studio portal.   |
| 4    | Finalize & Monitor              | Deploy and monitor your tasks to ensure correct execution and adjust settings if needed. |

## Core Features

KALP Web3 Functions provide **serverless automation** for on-chain tasks using Solidity.  
When designing your function, you can select from supported trigger types and execution targets.

### Trigger Types
- **Time Interval** – Run after a set duration (e.g., every 30 days).  
- **Cron Expressions** – Schedule with precise timing (e.g., every Monday at 00:00).  
- **On-Chain Event** – Trigger when a specific event is emitted.  
- **Every Block** – Execute with each new block.  

### Execution Targets
- **Solidity Function** – Directly call a contract method (e.g., `executeProposal()`).  
- **Transaction** – Perform a generic on-chain transaction (e.g., token transfers).  
- **Webhook** – Send a notification to an external system (e.g., Slack, email).  

## Prerequisites for Target Smart Contracts

To integrate smoothly with KALP Web3 Functions, your contract must meet these requirements:

- Functions should be **public or external**.  
- Functions should ideally be maintenance-style (e.g., reward claiming, governance execution).  
- Avoid hard restrictions like `onlyOwner`, unless the KALP executor is explicitly whitelisted.  
- Do not use `tx.origin` for access control; use `msg.sender` instead.
