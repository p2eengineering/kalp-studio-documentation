# How to Get TestNet Gini Tokens Using Kalp Studio Faucet

## **Introduction**

In the world of blockchain and decentralized applications, testing is key to development. A faucet is a tool that allows developers to get test tokens for experimenting with features on the testnet. Kalp Studio’s faucet gives you free Gini tokens, which you can use on the Kalp DLT Test Net. Remember, these tokens have no monetary value; they are for testing purposes only.

Follow these simple steps to receive 1 free Gini token in your Kalp wallet using the Kalp Studio faucet.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

 **Understand the Token Usage**  
    Remember, the Gini tokens you have received are test tokens for the Kalp DLT Test Net. These tokens are only valid for testing on the testnet and cannot be used on the main network. Use these tokens to deploy smart contracts, test applications, and debug transactions on the Kalp testnet.
    

## **Conclusion**

Using the Kalp Studio faucet is a straightforward process for developers looking to test their decentralized applications on the Kalp DLT Test Net. By following these steps, you can easily obtain free Gini tokens to enhance your development and testing activities. Remember, these tokens are strictly for testing purposes and have no real-world value. Enjoy experimenting on the Kalp platform!
