# **How to generate API Key for Email?**

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial for modern software development, enabling different applications to communicate and share data. When using services like K&LP Studio's Email platform, an API key acts as a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication, allowing your applications to securely access and utilize the email functionalities offered.

This guide will walk you through the straightforward process of generating a new API key for the Email service.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Generating Your Email API Key

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Billing Section**

1.  On the left-hand navigation sidebar, click on **"Billing"**. This will take you to the billing management page where you can view your subscriptions.

### **Step 3: Access API Key Generation**

To generate an API key for a specific service, you would need to:

1.  Click on the **"Email" service entry** itself.
    
2.  Look for an "Manage," "Settings," or "API Keys" option associated with the Email service row.
    

This action should navigate you to a page or prompt a dialog for managing API keys for the Email service.

### **Step 4: Initiate New API Key Creation**

1.  You will be presented with a modal (pop-up window) titled **"New API Key for Email Service"**.
    
2.  The prompt will state: "Create new API key to use."

### **Step 5: Provide Key Details**

In the modal, you'll need to fill in the following fields:

1.  **Key Name (Required):**
    
    -   Enter a descriptive name for your API key. This name is for your reference and helps you identify the key's purpose later.
        
    -   The input field is marked with a red asterisk, indicating it's mandatory.
        
2.  **Key Description (Optional):**
    
    -   You can optionally provide a more detailed description for this API key. This can be useful for further context if the key name isn't sufficient.
        

### **Step 6: Create the API Key**

1.  After filling in the "Key Name" (and optionally, the "Key Description"), click the **"Create"** button.

### **Step 7: Confirmation and Key Retrieval**

1.  Upon successful creation, you will be redirected to the **"API Keys"** page, with the "Email" service tab.
    
2.  A success notification (e.g., a green banner with "SUCCESS") will appear, confirming the key has been generated.
    
3.  Your newly created API key will be listed in the table. The table displays:
    
    -   **Key Name:** The name you provided.
        
    -   **Last Used:** Will show "-" or "Never" for a new key.
        
    -   **API Auth Key:** This is your actual API key. It will be partially masked for security. **You will be shown the full key only once upon creation. Make sure to copy and store it in a secure location immediately.**
        
    -   **Date Created:** The timestamp of when the key was generated.
        
    -   **Status:** An indicator (e.g., a toggle switch) showing if the key is active.
