-  **Token Initial Supply**: Set the initial supply, which is the number of tokens created when the contract is deployed.

-  **Pausable**: Allows the owner to pause all token transactions in case of emergencies.

Toggle these options as per your token’s requirements.

Once you have configured all the parameters, double-check your entries. When you are ready, click **Create Token**. The platform will process your token creation request, deploying the token contract on the blockchain.
