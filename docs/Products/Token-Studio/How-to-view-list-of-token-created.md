#### **Detailed Information Available**

Each token entry includes the following key attributes:

##### **a. Symbol**

-   The unique shorthand identifier for the token (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin, ETH for Ethereum).
-   This is user-defined during the token creation process.

##### **b. Name**

-   The full name of the token as specified during creation (e.g., "MyToken").
-   Provides a descriptive name to easily identify the token.

##### **c. Type**

-   Indicates the type of token:
    -   **Fungible Tokens**: Interchangeable tokens like ERC20 (e.g., cryptocurrency).

##### **d. Initial Supply**

-   The number of tokens that were created at the time of deployment.
-   Represents the starting quantity of tokens available.

##### **e. Maximum Supply**

-   The upper limit of tokens that can ever exist for this token.
-   Ensures users can cap the total number of tokens to prevent inflation.

##### **f. Blockchain**

-   The blockchain on which the token resides (e.g., Kalp DLT).
-   Helps users track the token's compatibility with specific blockchain networks.

##### **g. Network**

-   Indicates the specific network within the blockchain ecosystem where the token was deployed (e.g., Kalp's  Devnet, Mainnet).
-   Helps identify whether the token is in a testing or live environment.

##### **h. Transaction ID**

-   A unique identifier generated when the token is deployed on the blockchain.
-   Used to verify and track the deployment transaction.

----------

#### Clickable Transaction ID**

-   The **Transaction ID** is a clickable link.
-   Clicking the link redirects you to the blockchain explorer of the respective network.
-   On the blockchain explorer, users can view:

    1. Detailed transaction history.

    2. Timestamp of the token deployment.

    3. Gas fees paid for deployment.

    4. Contract address of the token.


## Step 4: Manage Each Token

Each token entry might include additional actions based on its type and your subscription plan. You can view detailed statistics, manage token distribution, or even pause/resume token activity if you enabled the **Pausable** feature during creation.



## Step 5: Filter and Search Tokens

If you have created multiple tokens, you can use the search bar or filter options to quickly locate specific tokens by their name, symbol, or status. This makes it easier to manage large token portfolios within the Kalp Studio environment.

  

## Important Tips

-  **Organize with Descriptions**: When creating tokens, add a clear description to each one. This will make it easier to identify them in the list.

-  **Monitor Active Status**: Regularly check the status of your tokens, especially if they are part of active blockchain projects.

  

## Conclusion

Kalp Studio provides a user-friendly interface to not only create tokens but also manage them efficiently. By following these steps, you can easily view and monitor the list of tokens you've created, ensuring you stay informed about each token’s status and details. This feature is particularly valuable for users managing multiple tokens or developing comprehensive blockchain applications with Kalp Studio’s Token Studio.
