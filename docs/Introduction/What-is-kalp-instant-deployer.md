# Kalp Instant Deployer (KID) Overview

Kalp Instant Deployer (KID) is a powerful service designed to automate the deployment of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks. KID simplifies the deployment process, providing real-time status tracking and ensuring secure and efficient contract management. This overview highlights the key features, processes, and benefits of the Kalp Instant Deployer.

## Key Features

### Simplified Deployment Process
KID abstracts the complexities of smart contract deployment, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. By automating the deployment steps, users can focus on their contract logic without worrying about the deployment intricacies.


### Real-Time Status Tracking
After initiating a deployment, users can track the status of their smart contracts in real time. A transaction hash is provided, which is used to monitor the progress and confirm the successful deployment of the contract.

### Token and Subscription Validation
Each deployment request includes a bearer token. KID validates the token and checks the user's subscription status to ensure they have the necessary permissions and active subscriptions to use the service.

## Detailed Process

### Token and Subscription Validation
Each deployment request must include a bearer token. The validation process involves:
- **Token Reception**: The bearer token is received with the deployment request.
- **Validation Service**: The token is sent to a validation service to verify its validity and the user's subscription status.
- **Proceed or Reject**: If the token is valid and the subscription is sufficient, the request proceeds. Otherwise, it is rejected.

### Contract Identification
After validating the token and subscription, the service identifies the type of smart contract:
- **Contract Verification**: Determines whether the uploaded smart contract is KALP DLT based.
- **Contract Handling**: Handles the contract appropriately based on its type for deployment.

### Sending Deployment Request
Once the contract type is identified, the deployment process begins:
- **Request Formation**: Formulates a request to the wallet service with the contract details.
- **Deployment Request**: Sends the request to the wallet service for deployment.
- **Transaction Hash**: The wallet service deploys the smart contract and provides a transaction hash for tracking.

### Status Tracking via Cron Job
KID includes a cron job mechanism for regular status updates:
- **Cron Job Execution**: A cron job runs at specified intervals (e.g., every minute).
- **Fetch Status**: The cron job fetches the status of all pending smart contracts using the transaction hash.
- **Update Response**: Updates the status information in the response database or system accordingly.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automates and simplifies the deployment process, saving time and reducing manual errors.
- **Accessibility**: Makes smart contract deployment accessible to a wider audience, including those with limited technical expertise.
- **Security**: Ensures secure deployment through token validation and secure communication channels.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time status updates, keeping users informed about the progress of their deployments.

## Conclusion

Kalp Instant Deployer (KID) is a robust tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of deploying smart contracts. By automating the deployment process, supporting multiple blockchain networks, and providing real-time status tracking, KID offers a comprehensive solution for developers and users seeking to deploy smart contracts quickly and securely.
