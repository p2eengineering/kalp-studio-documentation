# How to Deploy a Smart Contract on KALP Studio

KALP Studio provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface for deploying smart contracts on the blockchain. In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps involved in creating and deploying a smart contract using KALP Studio. The images provided will serve as visual references to help you follow along with each step.

#### Step 1: Access KALP Studio Dashboard

Once you log into KALP Studio, you'll be greeted by the dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all your blockchain-related activities. Here, you can navigate to various sections such as Smart Contract, API Gateway, Transactions, and more.

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Smart Contract Section

On the right-hand side of the dashboard, you'll see a menu. Click on the "Smart Contract" option to start the process of creating and deploying a new smart contract. This will take you to the Smart Contract management page, where you can view and manage all your existing contracts.

#### Step 3: Start Creating a New Smart Contract

In the Smart Contract section, click on the "+ Deploy New" button to start the creation process. This action will guide you to a form where you can input the necessary details for your smart contract.

#### Step 4: Fill in Smart Contract Details

You'll need to provide various details about your smart contract:

-   **Name:** Enter the name of your smart contract (e.g., "Test").
-   **Category:** Select the appropriate category from the dropdown (e.g., "Mining/Farming").
-   **Description:** Provide a brief description of your smart contract's purpose.

Make sure to select the right blockchain network (e.g., TESTNET) and review all details carefully.

#### Step 5: Upload your Smart Contract Template

 If you have a custom smart contract, you can upload it using the "Upload Smart Contract" option. 

!!! Note
    Supported Smart Contract File Formats

    Please note that we only support the following file formats for uploading custom smart contracts:

    - `.tar.gz`
    - `.tar.xz`
    - `.zip`

    Ensure that your smart contract files are compressed in one of the above formats before uploading. Files in other formats will not be accepted.

#### Step 6: Choose existing Smart Contract Template

KALP Studio offers ready-to-use templates to make the deployment process faster and easier. You can select a template from the KALP Library (e.g., KRC721 for NFTs).

#### Step 7: Review the Smart Contract

Before finalizing, KALP Studio will present a review screen showing all the details of your smart contract. This is your last chance to ensure everything is accurate before deployment. Double-check the selected template, category, and all other information.

#### Step 8: Deploy the Smart Contract

After reviewing, click the "Continue" button to deploy your smart contract. KALP Studio will process the deployment, and within a few moments, you'll receive a confirmation message indicating that your smart contract has been created successfully.

#### Step 9: Manage Your Deployed Contracts

Once deployed, your smart contract will appear in the list of active contracts on the Smart Contract management page. Here, you can monitor the status, make edits, or interact with your contract via the provided API endpoints.
