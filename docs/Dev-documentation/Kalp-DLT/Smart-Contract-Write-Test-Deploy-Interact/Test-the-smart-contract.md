# Test the Smart Contract

### Smart Contract Verification and Testing

**Step 1:** Verify your smart contract's syntax and functionality by compiling it using the following command:

``` go
$ go build .
```

**Step 2:** A successful compilation signifies that your code adheres to Go language syntax rules and is free of errors.

**Step 3:** Proceed to test your smart contract to ensure its behavior aligns with your expectations. Utilize appropriate testing frameworks or unit tests to simulate interactions with your smart contract and verify its outputs. This step is crucial for identifying and rectifying any potential issues before deployment.
