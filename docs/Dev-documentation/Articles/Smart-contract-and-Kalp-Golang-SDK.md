# Smart contract and Kalp Golang SDK


## A Guide to Smart Contracts and Kalp Golang SDK

Smart contracts are revolutionizing the way we manage agreements and transactions. Just like traditional contracts, they lay out the terms of a deal. But what makes smart contracts different—and "smart"—is that they don’t rely on paper or lawyers. Instead, they exist as code running on a blockchain. This means they can securely automate virtually any kind of deal or transaction, with no need for a middleman like a bank or a lawyer.

Let’s explore how smart contracts work and how the Kalp Golang SDK can help you build powerful decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts.

### What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing piece of code that enforces the terms of an agreement automatically. Think of it like a vending machine: you insert money, select your item, and the machine either gives you the product or returns your money if something goes wrong. All of this happens without any human intervention.

In the same way, a smart contract automates actions based on pre-defined conditions. Once a smart contract is deployed on a blockchain like Ethereum, it cannot be easily altered or reversed, making it secure and reliable.

Smart contracts are used in many different areas:

-   **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Automating loans, savings, and insurance without needing a bank.

-   **Gaming:** Creating in-game economies where players can trade items securely.

-   **Supply Chain:** Tracking goods and ensuring payment upon delivery.

Once a smart contract is on the blockchain, anyone can inspect its code and see exactly how it works.


### How Smart Contracts Work

Smart contracts are written in programming languages like **Solidity** (for Ethereum) or **Golang** (for Kalp blockchain). When you deploy a smart contract, its code is stored on the blockchain and is executed by every node (or computer) on the network. This decentralized execution ensures that smart contracts operate without any single authority controlling them.

Here’s how it works:

1.  **Deployment**: A developer writes the contract and deploys it to a blockchain.
2.  **Execution:** When a user interacts with the contract, its code is executed by all the nodes in the network.
3.  **Consensus:** Every node reaches an agreement on the contract’s output, making the process tamper-proof.


### Introducing the Kalp Golang SDK

If you’re ready to build your own smart contracts, the Kalp Golang SDK provides everything you need to interact with the Kalp blockchain. Whether you’re developing financial tools or games, the Kalp SDK streamlines the development process.

#### Why Use the Kalp Golang SDK?

The Kalp SDK simplifies smart contract development by providing tools to:

-   **Manage Transactions:** Submit and track blockchain transactions easily.
-   **Integrate KYC Checks:** Make sure users comply with regulations.
-   **Track Payments:** Monitor payments in real-time for payable contracts.
-   **Debug Contracts:** Use enhanced logging features to troubleshoot issues.

#### Getting Started with Kalp SDK

Before diving in, you’ll need the following:

1.  Go Programming Language: Since the Kalp SDK is written in Go, you’ll need to have Go installed on your system. Download it from [Go’s official site](https://golang.org/dl/).
2.  Install the SDK: You can install the Kalp SDK using this command: bash
```
`go get -u github.com/p2eengineering/kalp-sdk-public/kalpsdk`
```
Once installed, you can start building your smart contract by defining a Go struct and embedding the kalpsdk.Contract for key blockchain functionalities.

### Building a Smart Contract with Kalp SDK

Here’s a quick guide to creating a smart contract with the Kalp SDK:

1. Define the contract

```go
type  MyContract  struct  {

kalpsdk.Contract

}
```
This simple structure forms the foundation of your contract, allowing you to store data, manage transactions, and interact with the blockchain.

2.  Key Features of Kalp SDK:

   -   **Data Management:** Store and retrieve data on the blockchain using key-value storage.
   -   **Transaction Handling:** Easily submit, query, and track transactions.
   -   **Payment Tracking:** Keep tabs on payments made through the contract.
   -   **KYC Integration:** Ensure regulatory compliance by embedding KYC checks.

### How to write Smart Contract with Kalp SDK on Kalp Blockchain:

  Creating and Starting Chaincode:

1.  Create a new directory for your project.
    a.  Execute the following command to create a new directory named for example-`my-smart-contract`
    b.  Change the directory into the newly created project directory.

2. Initialize a new Go module: Within the `my-smart-contract` directory, run the following command to initialize a new Go module named `my-smart-contract`:

```go
$ go mod init my-smart-contract
```
3. Getting Started with Kalp-SDK: Use the `go get` command to download and install the Kalp SDK library:

```go
$ go get -u github.com/p2eengineering/kalp-sdk-public/kalp
```

4. Now create a new Go source file`.go` within your project directory. This file will house the core logic of your smart contract.

```go
package main

import (

"fmt"

"github.com/p2eengineering/kalp-sdk-public/kalpsdk"

)

type SmartContract struct {

kalpsdk.Contract

}

func (sc *SmartContract) ExecuteTransaction() {

// Implement the logic for executing transactions

fmt.Println("Executing transaction...")

}

func (c *SmartContract) Init(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface) error {

// Initialization logic return nil

}
```
For detailed guidelines on writing smart contracts, please refer [https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Write-the-smart-contract/](https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Write-the-smart-contract/)

### EXAMPLE USAGE-

Let's create a sample hello world smart contract -

```go
package main

import (

"fmt"

"github.com/p2eengineering/kalp-sdk-public/kalpsdk"

)

type HelloWorldContract struct {

kalpsdk.Contract

}

// SetHelloWorld stores the "Hello World" message on the blockchain

func (h *HelloWorldContract) SetHelloWorld(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, messageID string, message string) error {

// Convert message to bytes for storage

messageAsBytes := []byte(message)

// Store message in the world state using the Kalp SDK

err := ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(messageID, messageAsBytes)

if err != nil {

return fmt.Errorf("failed to set message: %s", err.Error())

}

return nil

}

func main(){

}
```

**Build and package the smart contract:**

```go
go build .
```
Compress your folder structure to a zip file and you are ready to deploy the contract.
  

Folder Structure: After Executing the above commands, the folder Structure shows up as below:

```go
Folder name

├──vendor

├──go.mod

├──go.sum

├──main.go

└── contract

└── contract.go
```

### How to Deploy-

For deployment after building the smart contract please refer -[https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Deploy-the-smart-contract/](https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Deploy-the-smart-contract/)

## Ready to use Smart Contract Templates:
  

**KRC20 token contract:** implemented(hlink) in Go, utilizing the KalpSDK, provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities for managing digital assets on a blockchain network. The contract leverages the Kalp SDK for operations within a blockchain network, providing a framework for issuing, transferring, and managing tokenized assets compliant with the KRC20 standard.

**KRC721 token contract:**  implemented in Go. This contract utilizes the Kalp SDK to facilitate operations within a blockchain network, enabling the creation, management, and transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

**KRC1155 token contract:**  implemented in Go, utilizing the Kalp SDK for blockchain operations. The KRC1155 standard enables efficient multi-token transactions and interactions, supporting both fungible and non-fungible token types within a single contract.


### Conclusion:

#### Smart Contracts and the Future of Decentralized Applications (DApps)

Smart contracts make it possible to automate complex transactions without needing banks or other third parties. With the help of the Kalp SDK, developers can build powerful, secure dApps that can handle everything from finance to gaming.

As you continue your journey into blockchain development, remember that smart contracts:

-   **Automate agreements**: Removing the need for intermediaries.
