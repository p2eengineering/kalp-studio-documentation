# What is Kalp studio Wallet 

### What is a Crypto Wallet?🪙

Contrary to what the name might suggest, a crypto wallet doesn’t store cryptocurrency in the same way a physical wallet holds cash. Instead, a crypto wallet stores your **public and private keys**—the cryptographic information required to access your cryptocurrency on a blockchain network. 🔑

Crypto wallets provide an interface to manage your digital assets and facilitate secure transactions on the blockchain. With your wallet, you can transfer crypto, buy and sell tokens, and even interact with decentralized applications (dApps). 📲

### Not Sure What a Public or Private Key Is?🔑

A key is a long string of random, unpredictable characters. While a **public key** is like a bank account number and can be shared widely, the **private key** is like a bank account password or PIN and should be kept secret. Together, they are used to encrypt and decrypt data in the blockchain network. 🏦

### Why You Need a Crypto Wallet🛡️

If you're new to the world of cryptocurrency, it’s important to understand that your coins are not technically “stored” in your wallet but on the blockchain. A crypto wallet is crucial because it holds the **private keys** needed to access your assets. Without these keys, your cryptocurrency is inaccessible🔒.

## Different Types of Crypto Wallets🔄

### Self-Custodial Wallet🔓

-   The user has full control over their private keys and funds.
-   The wallet provider does not have access to or store private keys.
-   No need to trust a third party to safeguard assets.
-   Aligns with decentralization and security principles in cryptocurrency.
-   Reduces the risk of losing funds due to hacks or third-party mismanagement. 🛡️

### Custodial Wallet🛠️

-   The wallet provider manages and stores private keys for the user.
-   Suitable for those who prefer convenience over handling private keys.
-   The third party is responsible for safeguarding the assets.
-   Easier to recover access if private keys are lost, but less decentralized. 🏦

### How Do Cryptocurrency Wallets Work?💻

When you send cryptocurrency using a wallet, you’re not actually “sending” the tokens from your phone to someone else’s phone.

[Kalp Studio Wallet](https://docs.kalp.studio/Getting-started/Kalp-studio-wallet/How-to-Navigate-To-kalp-studio-Wallet/)
