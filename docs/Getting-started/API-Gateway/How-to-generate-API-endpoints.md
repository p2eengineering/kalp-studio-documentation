For the selected smart contract, click "Generate Endpoints." This action will create the necessary API endpoints.

### **View and Manage Endpoints**

After generating the endpoints, you can view and manage them. The status of each endpoint (success or failure) will be displayed, along with details like the network and blockchain used.

### **Check and Use API Parameters**

Click on "Check Params" to view the details and parameters for each API endpoint. This will help you understand how to integrate and use these endpoints in your applications.

By following these steps, you can efficiently generate and manage API endpoints for your smart contracts on KALP Studio, enhancing your blockchain development process.
