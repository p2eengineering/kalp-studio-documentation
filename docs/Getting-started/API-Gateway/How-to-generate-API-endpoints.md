# **How to generate API endpoints**

API endpoints are essential for integrating and automating various processes in blockchain development. KALP Studio provides a robust platform that allows developers to efficiently create, manage, and generate API endpoints for their smart contracts.

### **Login to Kalp Studio**

Navigate to the Kalp Studio login page and enter your credentials to access your dashboard.

### **Access the API Gateway Section**

If you haven't subscribed to any API Gateway, you'll see a message prompting you to subscribe.

!!! Note 
    To create and manage API endpoints, you need to subscribe to one of the plans   
    offered by Kalp Studio. Ensure you upgrade your plan if you're currently on the free  
    tier to access more features and higher limits.

### **Create or Select a Smart Contract**

Once subscribed, you can manage and generate API endpoints for your smart contracts. Select the desired smart contract from the list or create a new one.

### **Generate Endpoints**

For the selected smart contract, click "Generate Endpoints." This action will create the necessary API endpoints.

### Endpoint Generated

Once you select generate endpoint, a pop-up will appear, notifying that the endpoint has been generated.

#### View and Manage Endpoints

After generating the endpoints, you can view and manage them. The status of each endpoint (success or failure) will be displayed, along with details like the network and blockchain used.

#### Check and Use API Parameters

Click on "Check Params" to view the details and parameters for each API endpoint. This will help you understand how to integrate and use these endpoints in your applications.

By following these steps, you can efficiently generate and manage API endpoints for your smart contracts on Kalp Studio, enhancing your blockchain development process.
