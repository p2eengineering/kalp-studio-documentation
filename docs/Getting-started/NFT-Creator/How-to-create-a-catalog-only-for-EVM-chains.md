# How to create a Catalog? (Only for EVM chains)

Creating a catalog for your NFTs can make managing and organizing multiple assets on EVM-compatible chains simple and efficient. With Kalp Studio's NFT Creator, you can quickly set up a catalog tailored to your unique collection. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up a catalog within Kalp Studio.

!!! Note 
    Catalog on KALP Studio’s NFT Creator generally refers to the ‘collection of NFTs’ 
    Under a similar parent type.

1.  Open ‘NFT Creator’ by logging into KALP Studio console.
    
2.  In ‘NFT Creator’, navigate to the NFT Portfolio section located at the left sidebar menu (Fig.1).
    
3.  On the dashboard, if no NFTs are currently created, a message will appear saying, “No NFT yet!”
    
4.  Now click the ‘+ Create NFT’ button to start creating a new NFT.

    You need to connect a wallet first for creating a NFT, if not connected already.
