# Deleting an NFT

Managing your digital assets is an essential part of maintaining a streamlined and organized NFT portfolio. As your collection grows, you may occasionally need to remove certain NFTs, whether to declutter, replace outdated assets, or make room for new additions.

KALP Studio's NFT Creator makes it easy to delete NFTs directly from your portfolio.

!!! Note
    Deleting any NFT on the network costs applicable transaction charges.

1.  For added security, an **OTP (One-Time Password)** will be sent to your registered 
     email ID.
2. Enter the 6-digit OTP in the provided fields.
    
3. Click on **Confirm.**

### **Step 6: Confirm the Transaction Fees**

!!! Note 
    Manual approval to confirm the transaction fees will only be asked for Metamask  
    Wallets.

1.  After confirming the OTP, a MetaMask or wallet pop-up will appear to confirm the transaction.
    
2.  Review the **applicable fees** associated with the deletion. This fee is required for executing the contract interaction on the blockchain.
    
3.  If the fee looks acceptable, click **Confirm** in the wallet interface to authorize the transaction.
    
4.  A success message will appear confirming the deletion.

!!! Note 
    No transaction charges will be levied if minted on KALP DLT.

This process ensures that your NFT is deleted both from your Kalp Studio portfolio and the blockchain, with secure verification steps in place.

Always ensure that you genuinely want to delete the NFT, as this action cannot be undone.
