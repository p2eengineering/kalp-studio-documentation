# How to view your Catalog?

Navigating through digital assets is essential in any NFT platform, and Kalp Studio’s NFT Creator provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to view and manage NFT Catalogs.

### **Step 1: Log into NFT Creator**

Start by logging into your Kalp Studio account. Once logged in, open ‘NFT Creator’ under products and you will be directed to the main dashboard, which offers various options for managing and creating NFTs.

### **Step 2: Navigate to the NFT Portfolio Section**

On the left-hand side of the dashboard, you’ll see a navigation menu. Click on the **NFT Portfolio** option to expand it.

### **Step 4: Explore Your Catalogs**

Once in the **My Catalogs** section, you’ll see a grid displaying each catalog as a card. Each catalog card includes a representative image, the catalog name, and the total number of NFTs it contains. (For example, catalogs like "Dessert," "Food Catalog," "Headphone Music," and "Lights" each have unique images to help identify their content visually.)

### **Step 5: View Catalog Details**

-   Clicking on any catalog opens its detailed view, allowing you to explore the NFTs stored within.  
    (For instance, selecting the "NFTs" catalog displays NFT ‘Alien Symbiote’ minted within this catalog as shown in Fig. below)
    
-   The Catalog screen also shows essential details about the catalog like:
    
    -   Catalog Name
        
    -   Catalog thumbnail
        
    -   Creator's address
        
    -   Catalog description
