To begin deploying a smart contract, click the "Subscribe" button under the "Smart Contract Deployer" section. This will allow you to access the smart contract deployment tools.

### **Step 2: Creating a New Smart Contract**

#### Building Smart Contracts

![Kalp instant deployer](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1148605496-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F4gkv2XhY4CmWY6Vp0djW%252Fuploads%252Fe9FO9xlMLR4mlBOPFXlC%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3De548d91d-72f2-4281-888c-f9cabd1dac43&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=1d1a9712&sv=1)

After subscribing, you'll see the main deployment screen. Click on the "Create New" button to start building a smart contract.

### Entering Smart Contract Details
![Smart contract details](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1148605496-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F4gkv2XhY4CmWY6Vp0djW%252Fuploads%252FuTnwX54CCMcmGCTbfPfo%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2ebd80c8-ae58-481d-8bac-d185b4a7e858&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=64dc235&sv=1)

In this step, you need to enter the details of your smart contract:

-   **Name:** Enter a name for your smart contract.
    
-   **Category:** Choose a category for your smart contract (e.g., NFT, Token, DEX, DAO, etc.).
    
-   **Description:** Optionally, you can add a description for your smart contract.
    

### **Step 3: Uploading the Extension File**

#### Uploading Files

![Uploading files](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1148605496-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F4gkv2XhY4CmWY6Vp0djW%252Fuploads%252FF7SlHP89pECLEROwEQBK%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db1977ce8-108e-43f2-b4a3-5189f563426d&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f9f41ebf&sv=1)

Once the details are filled in, you will be prompted to upload an extension file. You can drag and drop your file into the designated area or browse your computer to select the file. The supported formats include .tar.gz, .tar.xz, and .zip, with a maximum size of 50 MB.

#### Successful Upload Confirmation

After successfully uploading your file, you will see a confirmation message. If needed, you can change the file at this stage.

### Step 4: Selecting a Template

#### KALP Template Selection

![Kalp template selection](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1148605496-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F4gkv2XhY4CmWY6Vp0djW%252Fuploads%252FeyoAR5sAHmZTN9yjsSdi%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbbfad6f1-bc4e-431a-b87c-12d542aba1e7&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=bb86e8fb&sv=1)

You can choose from a list of ready-to-use templates offered by KALP Studio. These templates can be selected from here and directly the smart contract is deployed, and amended as necessary before re-uploading to obtain API endpoints. This step helps you directly deploy smart contracts using pre-built templates.

### **Step 5: Reviewing and Deploying**

#### Review Details

Review all the details of your smart contract, including the name, category, description, and selected template. Make sure everything is correct before proceeding.

#### Deployment

![Deployment](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1148605496-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F4gkv2XhY4CmWY6Vp0djW%252Fuploads%252FxTaBoDEcspN79s5BQOcL%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D962ae839-c437-4bd1-b898-22357b89884b&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=23a9d3b8&sv=1)

Finally, click on "Continue" to deploy your smart contract. You will receive a confirmation message indicating that the new smart contract has been successfully deployed.

Deploying a smart contract on Kalp Studio is a user-friendly process that involves subscribing to the smart contract deployer, entering contract details, uploading the necessary files, selecting a template, and reviewing before deploying. Follow these steps, and you'll have your smart contract deployed in no time.
