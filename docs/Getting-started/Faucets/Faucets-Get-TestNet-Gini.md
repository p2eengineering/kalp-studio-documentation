# Faucets - Get TestNet Gini

## **Introduction**

In the world of blockchain and decentralized applications, testing and development are crucial. A faucet is an essential tool that provides free test tokens to developers to experiment with different features on a testnet. The Kalp Studio faucet allows developers to obtain Gini tokens for use on the kalp DLT Test Net, a test network used for development and testing. These tokens are not real cryptocurrencies; they hold no monetary value and are solely for testing purposes.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can get free 50 Gini on your Kalp wallet using the Kalp Studio faucet.

 **Understand the Token Usage**  
    Remember, the Gini tokens you have received are test tokens for the Kalp DLT Test Net. These tokens are only valid for testing on the testnet and cannot be used on the main network. Use these tokens to deploy smart contracts, test applications, and debug transactions on the Kalp testnet.
    

## **Conclusion**

Using the Kalp Studio faucet is a straightforward process for developers looking to test their decentralized applications on the Kalp DLT Test Net. By following these steps, you can easily obtain free Gini tokens to enhance your development and testing activities. Remember, these tokens are strictly for testing purposes and have no real-world value. Enjoy experimenting on the Kalp platform!
