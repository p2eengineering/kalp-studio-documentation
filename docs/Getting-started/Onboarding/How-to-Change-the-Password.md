# **How to Change the Password**

The "Forgot Password" feature is an essential component of any website or platform that allows users to recover access to their accounts when they have forgotten their passwords.

Resetting a password successfully is a seamless and straightforward process through the Kalp Studio. User(s) cannot enter Kalp Studio without logging in with the individual’s email and a correct password, matching with the database.

The below steps describe the user journey throughout the Reset Password process.
