-  **Token Name**: The name you assigned to the token.

-  **Symbol**: The symbol representing your token.

-  **Status**: Indicates whether the token is active or paused.

-  **Date Created**: The date and time when the token was deployed.



## Step 4: Manage Each Token

Each token entry might include additional actions based on its type and your subscription plan. You can view detailed statistics, manage token distribution, or even pause/resume token activity if you enabled the **Pausable** feature during creation.



## Step 5: Filter and Search Tokens

If you have created multiple tokens, you can use the search bar or filter options to quickly locate specific tokens by their name, symbol, or status. This makes it easier to manage large token portfolios within the Kalp Studio environment.

  

## Important Tips

-  **Organize with Descriptions**: When creating tokens, add a clear description to each one. This will make it easier to identify them in the list.

-  **Monitor Active Status**: Regularly check the status of your tokens, especially if they are part of active blockchain projects.

  

## Conclusion

Kalp Studio provides a user-friendly interface to not only create tokens but also manage them efficiently. By following these steps, you can easily view and monitor the list of tokens you've created, ensuring you stay informed about each token’s status and details. This feature is particularly valuable for users managing multiple tokens or developing comprehensive blockchain applications with Kalp Studio’s Token Creator.
